It is maintained and supported by NAVSA, BAVSA, AVSA and a number of independent institutions, and aims to make access to diverse scholarly editions and Victorian voices more widely available. Although all peer-reviewed material is open access, we charge a modest amount for use of our tools (for more information, see COVE Tools and Anthology Builder below). To facilitate its use throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, BAVS are offering some funds to support student access to develop specific projects.
